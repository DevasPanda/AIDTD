    "description": "To make AI and automation skills truly accessible by combining hands-on projects, mentorship, and real client work so that learners don't just collect certificates – they become confident builders.",
    "details": "We want every learner who passes through AIDT&D to ship something real: an agent, a bot, a workflow, or a tool that actually solves a problem for someone."

    "title": "Our Vision",

      "AIDT&D was born from a simple observation: there is a huge gap between what most courses teach and what teams actually need when they want to ship AI or automation into production.",
      "On one side, we saw students and professionals stuck in endless theory and tool-checklists. On the other side, we saw organisations struggling to find people who can design, build, and maintain AI agents, RPA workflows, and document understanding solutions on real infrastructure.",
      "AIDT&D exists to sit in the middle – as a studio that ships real solutions and a training ecosystem that prepares people to work on those solutions from day one."
